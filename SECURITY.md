# Security Policy
A security policy is a formal document that outlines an organization's rules and guidelines for protecting its information, systems, and physical assets. It establishes principles for managing security and ensures everyone understands their role in protecting the organization's assets by maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Security policies cover a range of topics, from high-level objectives to specific procedures like acceptable use, remote access, and password management. 
## Supported Versions
"Security Policy Supported Versions" is not a single answer, but a topic that varies by context, referring to the specific versions of operating systems, software, and protocols that a security policy or framework is designed for. For example, a security baseline might support Windows 11, version 24H2 and Windows 10, version 22H2, while a security policy for a web service might support protocols like TLS 1.3 and a specific set of cipher suites. 
Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.
